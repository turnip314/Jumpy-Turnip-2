Hello and welcome to Jumpy Turnip! This is the game about a turnip who wished it could fly (because why not?). 
Unfortunately, flying is not easy an there are many things stopping the turnip from achieving its dreams.
#
To play the game, press space to jump and click with your mouse to shoot. The turnip shoots in the general 
direction of your mouse, but the shots are affected by gravity, so you may need to adjust your aim.
#
Don't collide with the birds! They are your enemies and will weaken your turnip. A weak turnip is unfortunately 
unable to jump properly. Knock down the birds with your shots to score points.
#
As you play the game, your turnip will gain experience which helps it unlock new abilities. You can also buy upgrades 
for your turnip using money you get for winning each round (and occasionally for knocking down a bird or shooting down a supply crate). 
Spend your money wisely as your combination of upgrades can greatly affect how the later rounds of the game go. Keep in 
mind that different levels have different objectives, and so different upgrades would be useful in each scenario. Good luck! 
I believe in you!
#
You will soon encounter a new type of enemy: the fireball. Unlike birds, fireballs aren't living and aren't affected by 
things such as poison. They also have more health and deal more damage to your turnip. They also split into three parts when 
you kill them the first time. Yikes! On the bright side, they move much slower than birds.
#
In some levels, enemies reappear if you don't knock them down. This helps you get the points that you otherwise would've missed, 
but makes survival more of a challenge
#
Survival is not always a goal in some levels - especially endless ones where enemies keep spawning non-stop. In this case you win by 
achieving a certain score.
#
Behold... the flappy bird! The flappy bird is not necessarily tough on its own, but it can jump around making aiming and dodging challenge.
#
Some enemies have a regen status, which means that they heal themselves over time if you don't knock them down quickly enough.
#
Some enemies have a fade status, which makes them less visible than others. There are upgrades to combat this, but a keen eyesight and good 
memory will help as well.
#
Lots of flappy birds incoming. Good luck!
#
This level is slightly different from the others. You'll be going against the fireball boss. Bosses are harder to knock down than normal enemies 
but they give a lot of points. Keep in might that fireball splits when killed!
#
Clouds don't deal damage to you, but they weaken your attacks if you shoot through one. They can also remove any effects that your shots have, 
such as poison and fade remove.
#
Planes are strong and fast, but are worth a lot of points if you knock them down. They also have a high chance of dropping gold.
#
UFOs don't deal damage, but are hard to kill and paralyzes you if you come too close to one. Be careful!
#
Some turnips and upgrades will be really really useful for this round. Others not so much. You decide :)
#
It seems like the brids are migrating. Could this mean something is coming?
#
Final level. Good luck!
#
In freeplay, there is no end and you have no goal except to survive as long as possible and get as many points as possible. Good luck!
#
This is the upgrade menu for your turnips. You can buy skills here that make your turnip stronger and more capable while in the sky. Spend your money 
wisely as some upgrades are more helpful than others in different situations.
#
This is where you can buy new turnips and slots to bring different turnips along to battle. Use the keys 1, 2, 3,.. to change turnips in game. By default, 
you start the game with turnip 1.
#
You now have a second team member! Use 1 and 2 to swtich between them, and 3, 4, 5... up to 8 for each additional team member you have. When one turnip gets 
knocked down, another will come to take its place. Be careful though, as switching turnips takes health from you! As a bonus advice, you can "switch" a turnip
with it self to reset it back to its starting position.
#
One of your turnips now has an activated ability! When the ability bar fills up, press D to activate the ability. Abilities are great for use in emergency situations.
