# Jumpy-Turnip-2
Jumpy Tunrip 2 is a third-person shooter game with flappy bird movement mechanics, 30 regular levels, 4 freeplay levels, 8 player options, and 96 different upgrades.

The game is programmed in C++ and SFML by Andrew Luo (Jihanjie Luo), who is currently a first-year computer science student at the University of Waterloo. The graphics and images were made by Kayla Estacio.

To play the game, download the entire release folder and run the .exe application. The game is currently at its testing stage and will be updated frequently around this type.

To play the original Jumpy Turnip game which was written in Python, upload or copy-paste the code from the .py file (in the main folder) to codeskulptor.com, and click run (you may need to click run sveral times for it to work).
